print('Once upon a time there was a little boy named Turtle.')
print('Turtle liked playing football and eating june bugs.')
print('One day, he brought a pocketfull of june bugs on the field with him, but they all jumped out and scurried away from him.')
print('Much to Turtle's suprise, he quickly discovered the june bugs could spin and catch a spiral like nobody's business.')
print('Thus was born the first professional June bug football team.')
